# LogChain
LogChain is a decentralized provenance application that tracks the ownership and movement of a product or asset through its life cycle. It records each event or transaction that occurs, creating an immutable record of the history of the product or asset. By using a provenance system that leverages blockchain technology, customers can have confidence that the products they are purchasing are genuine and not counterfeits.
