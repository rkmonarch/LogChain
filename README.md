# LogChain
LogChain is a decentralized supply chain management application that provides utilities to companies, vendors, and customers for adding legitimate products with a manufacturing history and authenticating products in the market. With a blockchain-based system, every transaction and movement of a product can be recorded and verified, creating a transparent and immutable record of the product's journey. This can help to increase efficiency, reduce the risk of fraud, and improve traceability and accountability throughout the supply chain. So the customers can easily verify the counterfeit products in a secure channel.
